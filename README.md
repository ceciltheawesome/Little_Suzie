I made my first game

Arrow keys to move, z to swing the sword, but if that isn't obvious when you start the game then I did something wrong.

Windows and linux builds work. I assume the mac build works, but I can't test it. If you have trouble with the mac build, let me know and I'll try to fix it.

If you're one of those not-so-computer-savy-people, just open the zip file and extract the folder that's relevant to your OS (if you're running windows, extract the windows_build folder, etc). Also, make sure to download the whole build folder, not just the .exe or it won't work.

If you're running linux, make sure to set the .x86 file permission to allow running as an executable.

I'll probably upload the project files... I guess.
