Windows and linux builds work. I assume the mac build works, but I can't test it. If you have trouble with the mac build, let me know and I'll try to fix it.

If you're one of those not-so-computer-savy-people, just open the zip file and extract the folder that's relevant to your OS (if you're running windows, extract the windows_build folder, etc).

If you're running linux, make sure to set the .x86 file permission to allow running as an executable.

design documentation to follow.
I'll probably upload the project files too... I guess.
