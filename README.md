I made my first game

Windows and linux builds work. I assume the mac build works, but I can't test it. If you have trouble with the mac build, let me know and I'll try to fix it.
If you're running linux, make sure to set the .x86 file permission to allow running as an executable.

design documentation to follow.
I'll probably upload to project files... I guess.
